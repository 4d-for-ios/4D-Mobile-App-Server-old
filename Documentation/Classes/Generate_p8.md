// # Generating .p8 key file :key:

// To generate a .p8 key file, go to [Apple developer account page](https://developer.apple.com/account/), sign in, then select "Certificates, IDs & Profiles". 

// Image

// Next, select "Keys".

// Image

// Click the "+" button to add a new key.

// Image

// In the new key page, type in your key name and check the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) box, then click "Continue" and click "Register".

// Image

// Then proceed to download the key file by clicking "Download".

// Image

// The Auth Key filename will look like this : AuthKeyABCD1234.p8, the ABCD1234 is the Key ID for this key, we will need this Key ID later.

// Thatâ€™s it for generating the .p8 key file! Remember to keep the key file safely as you can only download it once, if you lost the key file, you will need to revoke it and register a new one.
